      <b>HTML Tags and Elements</b>
        <p>
        HTML Documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.
        When coding in HTML we provide the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
        </p>
    </div>

      <b>Types of HTML Tags</b>
      <p>
        <ul>
         <li>Anchor represented by "a" which is used to display links.</li>
        <li>Bold represented by "b" which is used to turn the text bold.</li>

      <b>Why computers called Stupid?</b>
        <p>    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
          literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
          small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
          in a program.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
      <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
      elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
      them.

     <h1><b>Creating a Structured Document</b></h1>
     <h2>Major Concepts</h2>

    <div>
     <b>Developer Tools(in browser)</b>
       <p>
         All the elements in the page are either in the form of <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em> elements.Blocks elements encloses
         a "invisible box" with contents inside it.
      </p>

      <b>Document Object Model[Tree-like Structure]</b>
          <p>
              A cross platform and language independant convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML.
         </p>
         <p>
            In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
            of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
            inside of boxes, and so on...

     <b>Boxes v/s HTML</b>
       
       <p>
         Boxes that we formed from the DOM we can make them into separate divisions inside a HTML Document.
       </p>

       <p>
          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
