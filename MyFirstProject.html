<h1><b>Getting Started with HTML</b></h1>
<h2>Major Concepts</h2>

<b>World Wide Web</b>
<p>Web is a collection of <em>HTML</em> Documents.It contains hyperlinks.Main type of document on web is HTML though it contains plain text,audios,videos,images and other stuffs.</p>

<b>Components of a Web</b>
<p>1.User's computer and <b>Browser</b> where browser is a program that run on a computer to display files from web.<br>
  2.Internet<br>3.Servers which is a computer that is optimised for hosting files.</p>
<b>How a web works?</b>
<p>When a person opens a webpage like www.udacity.com,user's computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server.</em>
  The server finds appropriate HTML document and sends it back to user's computer <em>web browser</em>is used to display it on user's computer.</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>HyperTextMarkupLanguage.</em><br>
  It contains:<br>
  1.Text content[what you see].<br>
  2.Markup[what it looks like].<br>
  3.Reference to other documents like images,links etc.</p>

<b>HTML Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML Documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.
  When coding in HTML we provide the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.</p>
<b>Types of HTML Tags</b>
<p>1.Anchor represented by "a" which is used to display links.<br>
  2.Bold represented by "b" which is used to turn the text bold.<br>
  3.Emphasis represented by "em" which is used to turn the text italic.<br>
  4.Break represented by "br" which is used to break from on line.<br>
  5.Paragraph represented by "p" which is used to write text in paragraphs.<br>
  And there are much more you can check it out in the documentation <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">here</a>.</p>

<b>Why computers called Stupid?</b>
<p>    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.

<b>FAQ</b>
<p>1.What happens if you forgot to close a tag?<br>
  Ans:Closing tags will be automatically generated by major editors that we use.</p>
  <p>2.What is a void Tag?<br>
    Ans:A <em>void</em> Tag do not need any contents and therefore no closing tag is present inside a <em>void</em> Tag.</p>
